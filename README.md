Overview
========

This Symfony2 bundle aims to provide classes to build you own command management

The idea is:

1. Use CommandManager in your command Classes (start and stop function)
2. Declare its name and ID
3. The tool will manage queuing instance for you, based on the id/group
4. Watch performance / log on screen (require to create the interface or use AdminSonata for fast renderer)
