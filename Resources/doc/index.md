Theory
======

This tool allow you to save quickly and easily performance time and logs. But it allow you as well to manage line up in commands, 
in order to not overload a server or other situations.

It give entities to display on screen via a controller for an interface control.

Each command is independent and is managed by itself. In case of a crash, this command will be manage by the next in line.

No real time manager is running in background, just php script. No dependencies from linux or windows.


Improvements
============

To Do :

- create interface :
    * run command from interface
    * watch actual command status
    * see historic
    * create dashboard with running script, last executed script, last crashed script
- dependencies between commands, when start
